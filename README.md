In our work, we present a simulation of a CT Scanner, built in with a simple functioning
Graphical User Interface using MATLAB and the add-on, App Developer. We use two test
phantoms with simple shapes along with MATLAB’s base phantom(), which produces the
Shepp-Logan Phantom for our performance test. MATLAB had many incredible tools we were
able to utilize to easily showcase what we wanted, with minimal effort on our part.
